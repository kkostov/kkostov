### Hello, I'm Konstantin 👋 (he/him)

I'm a long-time human in tech from Belgium 🇧🇪, co-founder @ [Headbright Group](https://headbright.eu/)

I make infinite loops, apps and tools which are fun or useful or both. I split my time between freelancing for companies looking to team-up with a senior dev (IC or lead) and working on own projects.

Some of my public works include:

- [SwiftyFlags (Swift language feature flags)](https://flags.swiftythemes.com)
- [TootSDK (Swift library for Mastodon and the fediverse)](https://github.com/TootSDK/TootSDK)
- [FeedbackBulb (Privacy focused feedback platform)](https://feedbackbulb.com) 💡
- [CIBUS (Menu planning tool for catering and hospitality)](https://www.cibusapp.be)
- [Flutter SDK for TelemetryDeck](https://github.com/telemetryDeck/fluttersdk)
- [Kotlin SDK for TelemetryDeck](https://github.com/TelemetryDeck/KotlinSDK)
- [PretixSCAN for iOS](https://github.com/pretix/pretixscan-ios)
